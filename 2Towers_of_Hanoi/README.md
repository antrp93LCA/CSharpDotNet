# Tower of Hanoi

## Introduction

    The object of Towers of Hanoi is to move the blocks from one tower to another.  To win the game the stack must be in the same order from largest block on bottom to the smallest block on top.  

## How to Play the Game

    In this version of the game, the user will play the game in the console.  Instead of physical towers, the user will have the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a stack.  The user will be asked which stack they want to move from and which stack they want to move to.  There are some rules to the game. 

    1. A larger number cannot be placed onto a smaller number.
    2. You cannot move from an empty stack. 
    3. You can only move one number from the top of each stack at a time. 

    Once you have moved all of the numbers from the first stack to either the 2nd or 3rd, you have won the game.
